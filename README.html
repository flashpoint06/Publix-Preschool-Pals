<h2><a name="7"></a>7. TO SIGN-IN</h2>

<p>Click on the entry field at the top left of your screen. Type in your name. When you’re finished, click GO or hit the 
return key to begin. To resume a saved game, find your name on the list and click on it. Your name will appear in the text 
entry field. Click GO to begin.</p>

<br><br>
<h2><a name="8"></a>8. A BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE PALS' HOMETOWN</h2>

<p>Signing in takes you to an aerial view of the Pals' hometown, with all the places your children can visit – the fire station, 
library, art studio, playground, homes and Publix. It's here that your children choose a game to play. And really, 
it couldn't be easier. Rolling over the different areas prompts the Pal in that area to pop up. Plato, who's floating 
nearby in a hot air balloon, says to click the Pal to enter the game. To exit a game and return to this Hometown screen, 
click on the back arrow in the left hand corner of the page.</p>

<br><br>
<h2><a name="9"></a>9. CHANGING LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY</h2>

<p>Each game except Otis's Coloring Book has three levels. The games automatically start on the first level. To switch to 
another level, click on the "1 - 2 - 3" icon at the bottom of the page. This brings up the level-changing screen. The level 
you're on is highlighted at the top of the page. Simply click on the number of the level you want. Then click yes, and the 
game resets to that level. Or click no, and the game goes back to the current level. To exit the screen and return to the 
game, click on the back arrow button in the left hand corner of the page.</p>

<br><br>
<h2><a name="10"></a>10. ABOUT THE COINS</h2>

<p>Notice the "Coin" icon at the bottom of the page. It's in the bottom right corner. What's this all about? 
Simple. Your children earn coins for playing the games. Level 1, bronze coins. Each coin is made up of three pieces. 
They must play the game three times to earn a whole bronze coin. Level 2, silver. Each coin is made up of four pieces. 
Your children must play the game four times to earn a whole silver coin. Level 3, gold. Each coin is made up of six pieces. 
Your children must play the game six times to earn a whole gold coin. When they've earned a coin, they're taken to a screen 
where Plato congratulates them and drops their coin in a slot, which initiates the coin's fascinating journey to the bank. 
The "Coin" icon at the bottom of the page shows how many pieces of the coin your children have collected. To exit the coin 
bank screen and return to the game, click on the back arrow button in the bottom center of the page. There's one exception 
to all this. In the Kitty &amp; Kimmy game, your children will earn a piece of a coin each time they put one item, or multiples 
of one item on higher levels, into their shopping baskets.</p>
